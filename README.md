# Meet John

John is a talkative little fella. He usually won't talk to you though unless you
ask him a question, but his responses are very consise and to-the-point. He
always responds to a question.

## What does John do?

John's job is simple: He sits in your computer and issues orders to peripherals
based upon whatever you ask him to do. Then, he tells you how things went.

For example, if you have a bound introspection module, some chests, and say the
following:

> Hey John, take all of the cobblestone from my inventory.

John will use the introspection module to pull the cobblestone to the chests,
then respond something like,

> Got it, I've moved 27 cobblestone to the chest network.

or

> You don't have any cobblestone in your inventory!
